## Introduction
When it comes to working in today's day and age, change is the even, so we need to adapt and evolve with it if we are to flourish in the workplace of the future.
There are quite a few bits of information that points towards a change in the current and future working mindsets of individuals.
- The decline of full-time work
- Work continues to increase in complexity
- Limited connection between traditional education and our work
- Dream jobs donâ€™t exist
- People prefer autonomy over control
- Money is not a motivator
- People are meaner at work




This blog demonstrates these points in more detail: [future of work mindset](https://medium.com/betterworkingworld/future-of-work-mindset-shift-your-thinking-to-do-work-that-matters-16d889d6a3b3)

I designed this app to give people a head start before the swift. I designed it with the idea of being able to work where ever you can imagine, work on your dreams when it suits you.

With the change moving towards more freelance work i wanted to create a platform were user can quickly search up jobs their interested in, in their area, with the ability of accepting this job and getting into contact with the individual offering work.

Their is also a section for users that wish to offer work out for individuals too.  




## Features
- Allows users to easily browse through what jobs have been posted in their area.
- Offers the ability for employers have the opportunity to offer work to individuals in their area
-  Advertise yourself via your user profile. Be able to show off your pass work, show what certifications you have and most importantly show off your personality.
